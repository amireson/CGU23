Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis of Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission satellite data was performed to map ground deformation in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Ground deformation due to two earthquakes, 2015 Mw4.6 in British Columbia, 2022 Mw5.1 in Alberta, and 2017-18 Mw5.0 slow-slip events in British Columbia were observed. Time series analysis of InSAR data performed with the help of the Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) software also revealed continuous deformation at several sites. Rapid ground deformation, uplift and subsidence were observed in Alberta at the Cyclic Steam Stimulation site and a steady uplift at the Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage site. Subsidence was observed above underground potash mines in Saskatchewan, and subsidence and horizontal motion at the Smoky River Coal Mine in Alberta. An optimal processing methodology for ground deformation monitoring in this region is discussed.
