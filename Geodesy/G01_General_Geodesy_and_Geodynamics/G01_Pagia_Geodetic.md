Increasing recognition of geodesy as an Earth observing science is an ‘infinite game’ or an ‘endless frontier’ of change, adaptation, engagement, transdisciplinary research, and development of training capacity. What is our role and contributions in Canada vis-à-vis the world? Are we doing enough? Are we moving in the right direction? What are the challenges and opportunities? I will provide characteristic and diverse examples of geodetic and not so geodetic fundamental and applied research and how it measures up against adaptation, innovation, breakthroughs, impact and international cooperation and competitiveness.

Preferred format: Oral presentation
