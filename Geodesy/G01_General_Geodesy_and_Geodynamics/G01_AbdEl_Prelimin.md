Recently, the Canadian Geodetic Survey (CGS) installed a new relative gravimeter to replace the old aging Superconducting Gravimeter (SG) at the Canadian Absolute Gravity Site (CAGS) in Cantley, Quebec. The Micro-g gPhoneX relative gravimeter is deployed side by side with the SG and has been collecting gravity data since March 29, 2022. Determination of the gPhoneX instrumental drift remains a critical process for the study of long-term gravity changes. An FG5-236 absolute gravimeter is used to estimate and control the drift of both gravimeters. The drift of the gPhoneX is estimated for the last eight months and is less than 500 µGal/year. 
 In addition to the drift estimation, the gPhoneX performance is determined in terms of noise levels in the seismic, sub-seismic and tidal bands, using data spanning from March 2022 to March 2023. The gravity residuals are determined after removing Earth tide, atmospheric pressure, ocean tide loading and polar motion from the raw gravity data. Then the daily Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of the gravity residuals was computed and the five quietest days with the lowest RMS were selected. The Least Squares Spectrum Analysis (LSSA) is used to estimate the amplitude spectra, percentage variance and power spectrum density of for the five quietest days in different bands. The results show that the gPhoneX performance is promising in the tidal and sub-seismic bands.
