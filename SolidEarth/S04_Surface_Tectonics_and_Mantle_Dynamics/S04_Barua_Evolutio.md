The geoid is defined as the equipotential surface of the Earth’s gravity field, which coincides on
 average with the mean sea level of the Earth. This study is motivated by the fact that density
 heterogeneities within the Earth’s mantle give rise to geoid undulations. Subducting slabs are expected
 to dominate the mantle heterogeneity structure as they are colder and denser than the ambient mantle.
 We model the global geoid from subducted slabs in the upper mantle for the past 140 Ma at an interval
 of 40 Myr for 3 different radial viscosity structures. The models predict geoid highs above subduction
 zones whereas geoid lows are somewhat scattered. The modelled positive geoid anomaly is as high as
 110 m, and the negative anomaly is as low as -40 m. We have compared the present-day geoid from our
 models with that from upper mantle slab model RUM [Gudmundsson & Sambridge, 1998] and find
 that the correlations are 0.74, 0.65 and 0.80 for the three viscosity structures. As the correlations are
 quite good, we infer that the reconstructed subduction zones when run forward in time in our models
 can match the present-day geoid from the observed subduction zones. We also found that even if we
 start with the same density structure, the geoid models differ from each other based on different radial
 viscosity structures, and therefore the details of radial viscosity variations have important effects on the
 geoid.
