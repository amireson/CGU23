Geological and geophysical observations show instances of surface subsidence, uplift, shortening, and missing mantle lithosphere that are inferred as manifestations of mantle lithospheric drips. This process removes or thins the lithosphere in intraplate settings such as active orogenic regions (e.g., Central Andes and Central Anatolia). A series of scaled, 3D analogue/laboratory experiments were conducted with quantitative analyses using the high-resolution Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. Experimental outcomes reveal that a lithospheric drip may be either ‘symptomatic’ or ‘asymptomatic’ depending on the surface manifestations of the drip in the upper crust and determined by how well coupled a drip was to the upper mantle lithosphere. A symptomatic drip will produce subsidence followed by thickening/shortening, creating distinct ‘wrinkle-like’ structures in the upper crust whereas an asymptomatic drip yields subsidence or uplift, with no evidence of shortening in the upper crust. The method of drip initiation influenced how well coupled the drip was to the upper mantle lithosphere to promote shortening of the upper crust. Geological and geophysical data demonstrate these experimental outcomes are observed in nature. For example, seismic tomography and paleoelevation data reveal a possible symptomatic drip beneath the Arizaro Basin (Central Andes). Seismic tomography, surface strain and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data indicate a possible asymptomatic drip beneath the Konya Basin (Central Anatolia). The models reveal that different types of lithospheric drips may exist in nature, with instances where the mantle lithosphere is dripping with no distinct manifestations of such a process in the upper crust.
