Several parameters controlling vigour of mantle convection are likely impacted by water (e.g., yield stress, and activation energy). The activation energy determines the gradient of viscosity increase with temperature and is dominant in forming a stagnant-lid from ductile mantle. However, the viscosity gradient cannot be extrapolated from the temperature gradient alone. Absolute viscosity is determined by absolute temperature, so that the range of viscosities found through the mantle depend on surface temperature. Therefore, mantle convection's vigour and the stresses produced, depend on surface temperature, in contrast to depending only on the temperature difference between mantle boundaries. We investigate the influence of yield stress, mantle activation energy and, specifically, surface temperature, as controlling factors on surface mobility in Earth-sized planets. For yield stresses resulting in a stagnant-lid at Earth-like surface temperatures, when surface temperature is increased, the latter regime gives way to episodic- and mobile-lids at Venus-like surface temperatures. When activation energy is increased (i.e., drier mantle), stagnant-lid behaviour prevails. However, the generalized finding that surface mobility is supported by increased surface temperature is persistent. Our findings suggest that drier mantles, as opposed to mantles with simply a hotter surface, facilitate forming stagnant-lids, and that colder surfaces promote stagnant surfaces. Accordingly, the generation of mobile plates may be strongly dependent on the impact of water on lithospheric yielding, as well as requiring surface temperature warm enough to overcome surface stagnation promoted by low absolute mantle temperature.
