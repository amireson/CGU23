Gamma spectrometry is a useful tool to map the geology of soils and bedrock, to search for mineralization of porphyry systems, alkaline intrusions or potassium hydrothermal alterations, to explore natural resources such as uranium and thorium. A lot of spectrometric surveys (SIGÉOM) have been collected in Quebec, Canada in the past decades. However, spectrometric data processing (such as denoising, data leveling, compatibility of data collected at different times/instruments, imaging) and interpretation needs more research, especially advancing the interpretation from qualitative to quantitative in order to explore the potential application of spectrometric data. As part of a research project with the financial support of the FRQNT (Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Technologies de la nature), the new leveling methodology and additional corrections are under development. It will reduce the influence of radiation from other sources and improve the representativeness of spectrometric data with respect to geology. The preliminary result of the development will be presented at CGU.
