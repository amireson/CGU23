In the Coast Mountains of western British Columbia, an anomalous concentration of seismicity
 exists near the town of Bella Coola. This location is situated near the intersection of
 the Coast Shear Zone, a major NW-SE trending Eocene-age shear zone that accommodated
 deformation between the Pacific and North America plates, with the Anahim Volcanic Belt, an E-
 W trending zone of volcanic features that decrease in age to the east. A sequence of
 earthquakes in 1940 caused minor shaking in the town of Bella Coola, but little is known about
 the events due to the lack of instrumentation in the region at that time. From multiple
 observations we argue that the majority of these events are not associated with surficial processes. To augment the existing Geological Survey of Canada seismicity
 catalog, we apply an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian
 National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS
 deployment, resulting in an additional 433 events in the region with at least 3 paired P and S
 phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel
 to the Coast Shear Zone, and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the
 CSZ that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms
 exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. We hypothesize that interaction of the Anahim
 Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened lithosphere in this region
 leading to concentration current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest
 seismicity including swarm-like activity.
