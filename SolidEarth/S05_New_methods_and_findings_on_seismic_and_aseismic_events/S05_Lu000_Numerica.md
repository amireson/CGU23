Spatial overlaps of earthquakes and SSE slip patches have been observed in Mexico, Costa Rica, and possibly Japan subduction zones, suggesting potential interactions between the two fault slip modes. To explore the relationship between earthquakes and SSEs, we use the rate-and-state friction model to simulate the earthquake cycle with SSEs and large earthquakes on a non-planar fault for the Costa Rica subduction zone, where GPS inversions of slip distribution for SSEs from 2002 to 2020 and a 2012 Mw 7.6 earthquake can serve as constraints to model parameters. We assign different effective normal stresses Ïƒ in the SSE zone and the seismogenic zone to approximate the observed recurrence intervals of SSEs and earthquakes, respectively. The modeled SSE cumulative slip agrees with GPS inversions that the largest slip occurs southeast to the Nicoya Peninsula, with an average recurrence interval of 1.7 years and average migration speed of 1 km/day. Modeled SSE sequences demonstrate strong variations in their maximum slip rates and recurrence intervals during the interseismic period. In particular, preliminary model results show a temporary SSE quiescence following earthquakes, which is yet to be compared with GPS observations in Costa Rica and other subduction zones. To study the potential interaction between earthquakes and SSEs, we will focus on the spatiotemporal evolution of fault stress and slip near the earthquake patch throughout the earthquake cycle.
