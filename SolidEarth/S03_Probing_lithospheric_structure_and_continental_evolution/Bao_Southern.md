Syncontractional extension is prominent in present-day Tibet, but its origin remains vigorously debated. Several deep-seated geodynamic processes (e.g., Indian underthrusting, horizontal flow, and mantle upwelling) have been linked to Tibetan rifting. Underthrusting is a good candidate because it can well explain why surface rifts are more prominent south of the Bangongâ€“Nujiang suture; however, how underthrusting causes extension is not well understood and lacks observational constraints. Seismic anisotropy, measured by exploiting the birefringence effect of shear waves, can be indicative of the deformation styles within the crust. Here, for the first time, we unveil the dominant convergence-parallel alignment of anisotropic fabrics in the deep crust of the southern Tibetan rifts using seismic recordings collected from our recently deployed and existing seismic stations. This finding suggests that the strong north-directed shearing exerted by the underthrusting Indian plate is key to enabling present-day extension in southern Tibet.
