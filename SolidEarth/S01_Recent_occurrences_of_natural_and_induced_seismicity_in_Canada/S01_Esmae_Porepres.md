This paper focuses on the effects of sealing faults and associated lateral pore-pressure gradients on seismicity. The studied formation is the Montney across Alberta and British Columbia. The goal is to test the hypothesis that seismicity risk is elevated in areas of a high lateral gradient in pore pressure within the Montney Formation. We constructed a residual pore-pressure anomaly map by 1) compiling reliable measurements of pore pressure; 2) using kriging to grid the pore-pressure observations; 3) removing a regional trend that is representative of a transition from Deep Basin overpressure to normal pressure at the up-dip limit of the Montney; 4) computing the horizontal gradient anomaly. Initial Results indicate that earthquakes occur preferentially in areas of the high pore-pressure gradient. We also distinguished between natural and induced earthquakes to better understand the impact of Î”P on different categories of earthquakes.
