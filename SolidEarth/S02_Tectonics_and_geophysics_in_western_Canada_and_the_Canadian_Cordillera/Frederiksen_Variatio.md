Upper-mantle anisotropy is an important indicator of both frozen lithospheric fabric and active asthenospheric deformation, and is measurable beneath seismic stations by examining the splitting of plane-polarized shear waves. Previous work from our research group has measured splitting beneath the Mid-Continent Rift, Superior Province, and Williston Basin using a consistent directionally-balanced methodology. Here we extend that work westward to examine anisotropy beneath Saskatchewan and Alberta, within the limits of existing instrumentation. We use a newly-developed directionally-balanced splitting code that allows for fast, efficient quality control, and we take advantage of recent deployments of instrumentation for induced-seismicity detection and carbon-storage monitoring. Comparing our results with those from a recent study by Wu et al. (2019), which uses a different analysis approach, we find systematic differences in split times, with our results showing smaller split times. We demonstrate that this change results from the contrasting biases of different averaging methods, and explore its effect through simple models.
