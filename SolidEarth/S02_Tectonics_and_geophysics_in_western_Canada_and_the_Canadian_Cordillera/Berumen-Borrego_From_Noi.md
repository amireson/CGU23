As Canada moves towards a carbon neutral economy, geothermal energy plays a crucial role for the country. Geothermal energy may be particularly beneficial in Northern Canada, where many communities rely on diesel fuel for power generation. The Yukon Geological Survey leads a research program to assess the geothermal potential in several Yukon communities. With a mean annual temperature of -3°C, Burwash Landing, home of the Kluane First Nation, is considered a favourable environment for geothermal energy development. This is supported by an estimated geothermal gradient of 40°C/km, the presence of warm groundwater, and the proximity to the crustal-scale, dextral strike-slip Denali fault. 
 
 Continuous seismic data was recorded from 2021 to present using nine three-component broadband seismometers. We applied horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) measurements of ambient noise to estimate the fundamental resonance frequencies (𝑓0) of shear waves to infer the shallow seismic velocity structure. We note that all HVSR curves are characterized by a single peak but can be divided into three groups based on 𝑓0. We have estimated the thickness of the Quaternary sediments section between ~25 to 40 𝑚, close to the Denali Fault. A well drilled nearby encountered bedrock at a depth of ~50 𝑚. Moving to the NE of the fault, towards the Kluane Lake, the estimated thickness increases to a range between ~120 to 250 𝑚. Having constraints on the depth to bedrock is necessary to identify favourable locations for heat extraction from the subsurface and reduce exploration risks associated with drilling.
