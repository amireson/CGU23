Southern Yukon is characterized by complex tectonic processes due to proximity to the collisional arcuate continental margin. As a result of deformation partitioning, major transform faults (e.g., the Denali fault) exist that harbour significant earthquake potential. In addition, recent geoscientific evidence suggests increased geothermal potential is associated with these features. Geothermal energy is not widely used in Canada, and the location and extent of available resources are currently poorly understood. We are undertaking a study to resolve the structures and processes of these transform faults at regional to local scales, and to provide new knowledge about natural hazards and geothermal potential. At the regional scale, we investigate seismicity and its relationship to tectonic processes in southern Yukon (presented as separate abstracts). Here, we summarize our local, high-resolution seismological field campaign near Burwash Landing, Yukon; a potential site for future geothermal resource development. Several passive seismological data sets have been obtained to study the structure and nature of the Denali and Duke River Faults. Discoveries include the occurrence of repeating earthquakes which may be related to fluid movement in the subsurface, as well as new constraints on seismic velocities at crustal scales as well as overburden thickness. Combined, these results inform future geothermal investigations and provide insight on the potential hazards associated with large transform faults in southern Yukon.
