Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is deploying a national Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) for Canada, which is intended to be operational in 2024. The EEWS has been designed to provide warnings to the public and to critical infrastructure in regions of moderate-to-high seismic risk, using a network of sensors with fast communication links to redundant data centers. The sensor network locations have been chosen to provide warnings for most large earthquakes affecting Canada. Users have been provided guidance on simple protective actions to take upon receipt of a warning or feeling shaking through education outreach. Critical infrastructure operators, emergency response organizations and industrial facilities will benefit by using the alerts to establish protective protocols and automated response technologies.
 Extrapolation of the performance of Canadian National Seismographic Network stations operated by NRCan indicates the planned EEWS sensor network will have sufficient reliability and redundancy to meet EEWS program requirements. Offline testing of the EEWS algorithms using current and historical earthquakes indicates earthquake source parameter estimates can be performed with adequate speed for events in Canada. Canada’s EEWS employs the United States Geological Survey’s ShakeAlert® software system developed for California. Tuning the Canadian EEWS for different tectonic zones requires regional scaling of several parameters for the optimization of 1) magnitude scaling relationships, 2) seismic attenuation factors between inter- and intra-plate regions of seismicity and 3) corrections for spatially variable site conditions. In this work, we will present these region-specific parameters required for accurate local and regional alerting in the Canadian EEWS deployment.
