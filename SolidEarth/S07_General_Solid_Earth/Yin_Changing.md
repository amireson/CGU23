A number of colour palettes that are widely used to display critical scientific results not only distort data but are also unreadable to a proportion of the population. 
 
 An issue with the rainbow palette (and the variant known as jet) is that the gradients between the colours are not even. The impact of an uneven colour gradient is that certain colours are highlighted over others, distorting the data. Furthermore, an uneven colour palette like rainbow may be unreadable for people with a colour vision deficiency or colour blindness. 
 
 In the communication of all scientific results, data should be presented without distortion and be universally accessible. However, this is critical when communicating public facing information such as natural hazards. 
 
 Here, we show the impact of changing the visualisation profile on the Seismic Hazard Map of Canada on the perception of risk, as well as qualifying the accessibility of this information to the general public. 
 
 Our results reveal that an uneven colour map such as rainbow applied to Seismic Hazard data can exaggerate the lower hazard values and reduce the perception of extremely high hazard values. Applying an even colour gradient to the data changes the hazard perception across Canada, especially in the most populated cities, and also allows this essential public resource to be universally accessible to those with colour-vision deficiency. 
 
 We also highlight a number of potential next steps to promote inclusiveness in data visualisation, especially in the area of seismic hazard, and welcome discussion on science communication best practices.
