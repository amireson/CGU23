Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are well suited for collecting information at the whole-farm scale and are increasingly used in agriculture to provide valuable feedback based on the imaging they can provide. With their ability to carry a payload, UAV’s also have great potential as a platform for micrometeorological measurements to help answer questions regarding on-farm emissions. A series of test flights were made both above and downwind of a beef cattle feedlot with a UAV equipped with an air-sampling system. The sampling system was controlled by the drone pilot and allowed for the collection of 2 separate air samples from each UAV flight. Theses air samples effectively provided a flight-path averaged concentration of CO2, CH4 and N2O. With this information and collected wind data, 3 different micrometeorological approaches were employed to estimate emissions. Each technique experienced challenges in consistently generating reasonable estimates of emissions. Changing conditions during a sampling period, uncertainties in regards to wind measurements along the flight path, and the limitations of our path-averaged concentrations were all contributing factors that impacted emission estimates. It is hoped that with innovations in sensor technology and the ability to collect accurate, real-time concentration data, UAV’s will become a valuable tool for spot measurements of emissions from agricultural sources.
