CaMI.FRS is a project to inject limited CO2 amount into the shallow layers, and the goal is to detect CO2 plume and migration in the reservoir using high-resolution geophysical methods.
 Our studies demonstrated that activities are in different depths, mainly in shallow formations near the surface. We are describing the possible relationship between injection and microseismic activities that are recorded in 1- the near-surface and 2- the well, and 3- recorded in both. This research used frequency analysis for event discrimination from the noises.
