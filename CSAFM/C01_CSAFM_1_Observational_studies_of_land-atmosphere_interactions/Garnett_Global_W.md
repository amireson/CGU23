Abstract: 
  Warm weather events (WWE) are repeatedly announced by the media and scientific communities while extremely cold events (CWE) are rarely mentioned. An example is the extreme temperature of 49‚Å∞C at Lytton, British Columbia on June 29, 2021 compared to epic snowfall in Newfoundland in March 20-21 2020. 
  In this presentation, we provide examples of recent cold weather extremes (CWE) in Canada and worldwide to highlight the fact that they are on the rise. Recent examples are: the 76 low temperature records set in the U.S. between late November and late December 2022, the January 13, 2021 storm Filomena in Spain, the most powerful in 50 years, that brought record cold to parts of Spain and the winter season of 2013/14 in North America, one of the coldest and snowiest on record that had an economic impact of about US $100-150 billion dollars (U.S.A. and Canada combined)
  Our analysis suggests a linkage to large-scale oscillations like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the longest lasting La Nina since the 1970s and a weakening of the Sun with prospects a grand solar minimum in the next decade or so. Finally, we present the latest data on northern hemispheric snow accumulations and the implications that increasing CWE hold for economic impacts in the future.

Preferred format: Oral presentation
