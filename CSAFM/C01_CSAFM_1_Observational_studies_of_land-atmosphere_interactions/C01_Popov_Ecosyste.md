Obligatory mine reclamation efforts in the Athabasca oil sands region require leased land to be returned to pre-disturbance capacity. This entails the re-establishment of key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water cycling. Surface-atmosphere exchanges of energy and moisture are critical to ecohydrological processes and feedbacks that govern ecosystem functionality. Eddy covariance and remote sensing measurements were used to examine the temporal changes in energy partitioning of a reclaimed fen-upland watershed during the initial seven years post-construction. Surface conditions evolved from bare ground to robustly vegetated plant communities, altering albedo, surface roughness and plant-mediated shading. Initially in the fen, due to near-surface water table, high soil moisture content and low albedo (0.09) of bare peat, surface evaporation was high and most energy was partitioned to latent heat (QE). As the plant community developed and stabilized, QE remained the dominant energy flux, but a larger proportion of available energy was partitioned to sensible heat flux (QH) than in previous years. Moreover, effects of plant-mediated sheltering and shading decreased surface evaporative losses. In the drier upland, plant emergence and establishment was slower than in the fen. Initially, bare ground in the upland resulted in higher albedo (0.20-0.25), and QE and QH were similar. Once understory and treed species matured, QE increased with seasonal trends that mirrored plant phenology. By year seven energy fluxes and intra- and inter-seasonal trends at the constructed watershed were comparable to natural and post-disturbance boreal landscapes indicating the system is evolving towards a functional, reclaimed ecosystem.
