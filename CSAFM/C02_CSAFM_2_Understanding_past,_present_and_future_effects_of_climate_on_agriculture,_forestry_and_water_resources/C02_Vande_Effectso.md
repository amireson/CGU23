Methane emissions from manure storages are an important part of the carbon footprint of livestock production. These emissions are driven by the biological activity of methanogens and are therefore highly sensitive to temperature. This presentation will describe the results of an observational study where methane emissions were measured over a 7-year period, highlighting the interannual variability associated with varying weather. The presentation will also describe a modelling study that explores the variation of manure temperature and methane emissions associated with contrasting regional climates in Canada. Inter-annual weather variability led to substantial variation in emissions. Observational data suggest the variation is non-linear. Modelling results identify the variation in methane emissions in contrasting regions of Canada.
