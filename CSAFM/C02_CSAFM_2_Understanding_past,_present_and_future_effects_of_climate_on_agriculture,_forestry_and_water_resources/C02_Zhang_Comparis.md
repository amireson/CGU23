The Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF) is a crop yield modelling tool used by AAFC and Statistics Canada. A key input to the CCYF is satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), acquired from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. All platforms carrying AVHRR and MODIS sensors have either passed or are nearing the end of their designed life spans, thus the termination of the data delivery becomes imminent. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) offers a potential substitute for MODIS. In this study, a weekly composite of VIIRS NDVI is compared with the MODIS NDVI at both pixel and Census Agricultural Region (CAR) levels. The potential for VIIRS NDVI to replace MODIS NDVI is investigated by comparing the yield forecasting results for five crops using either of the datasets in 2022 growing season. The coefficient of the determination at pixel and CAR level between the VIIRS and MODIS NDVIs were 0.95 and 0.76 respectively. The larger discrepancy at CAR level was mainly caused by the differences in the number of valid pixels between the two datasets. The differences between the forecasted crop yields using the two datasets were within 5% in 75% of spring wheat CARs, 66% of canola CARs, 66% of barley CARs, 76% of grain corn CARs, and 74% of soybean CARs. Overall, VIIRS NDVI proved to be a promising substitute for the MODIS NDVI. More work in data processing and calibration is required to meet the operational needs.
