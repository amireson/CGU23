Recent large wildfires in central British Columbia have revealed the presence of wildfire refugia composed primarily of juvenile forest stands. In summer 2021 and 2022, 6116 fuel moisture content (FMC) observations were collected from duff, fine woody debris, and live foliage at six locations in central British Columbia. Samples were collected from co-located open, juvenile, and mature forest stands to assess the variability in FMC between different stand types. On average, the highest FMC was observed in duff (169 +/- 105%) and fine woody debris (50 +/-43%) at mature and juvenile stands. The average FMC for foliage was similar across all stand types and conifer tree species. A range of remote sensing indices for greenness and moisture, calculated from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 and 9 platforms, were used to estimate FMC, with errors between 15% to 80%. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and the Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) show reasonable predictive power for foliage moisture content in juvenile and mature forests, respectively. These results were applied to a case study of wildfire refugia in the Plateau Complex Fire (2017). In mature stands, burn severity measured by the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) showed a distinct relationship with pre-burn NMDI. In contrast, juvenile forests remained relatively unburnt at all levels of NDMI, which suggests that moisture levels are not a factor in the formation of juvenile stand wildfire refugia. These findings have implications for forest management and fire risk assessment in the central British Columbia region.
