Naturally occurring salt within the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) and its distribution is important for agricultural and livestock producers as unprecedented wet periods have contributed to growing concern of salinization. Salt transport is directly linked with water transport in this region To further the understanding of salt transport in the PPR, this project uses data collected from St. Denis National Wildlife Area from the past several decades to analyze the amount of salt entering and leaving wetland ponds and the associated climate and hydrological conditions that allow for transport to occur. Our analysis of this long term time series data gives insight into the effects of wet and dry periods on salt transport a. Salt content of wetland ponds has shown different behaviors depending on the climate (wet and dry periods) as well as the topographical position of the pond. A secondary objective of this study is to use 2D numerical modeling of a prairie wetland cross-section to investigate how salt is re-distributed under a variety of future climate scenarios; this will enhance capacity for prediction of wetland and soil salinity in the future.
