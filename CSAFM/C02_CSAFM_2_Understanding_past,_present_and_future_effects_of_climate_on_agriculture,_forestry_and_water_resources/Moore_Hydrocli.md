Negative impacts of climate change and watershed disturbance are becoming increasingly important for freshwater ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest region. Increasing air temperatures and changes to precipitation regimes alter streamflow and stream temperature, especially in snow-dominated watersheds. Changes in these habitat variables can impact the success of critical salmonid life stages, such as spawning, leading to decreased salmonid returns in subsequent years. Kokanee fisheries in the Okanagan Valley have immense economic and cultural value, however their continued success is threatened by a changing climate. The objectives of this research are to (1) determine how past trends in hydroclimatic and environmental variables, such as streamflow, air temperature, and precipitation, have influenced the timing and duration of kokanee spawning over the past 30 years in Peachland Creek and (2) predict how future climate change impacts on hydroclimatic variables may influence spawning start time and duration. To ensure resilient watersheds and kokanee populations for the future, understanding the conditions required for successful spawning is critical. Early analysis shows that streamflow and air temperature play an important role in these processes, and earlier spawning may be driven by an increasing trend in summer air temperatures.
