Horticultural peat extraction in Canada converts peatlands from long term net sinks to net sources of carbon. The surface vegetation is removed, and drainage ditches are installed every 30 m, subdividing the sites into fields of exposed peat. Few studies in Canada have assessed the carbon balance of these sites during active extraction. 
 
 We conducted research at an active site near Seba Beach, Alberta. Our objectives were to use plot and ecosystem-scale approaches to understand the spatial distribution and environmental controls of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. We measured plot scale carbon fluxes weekly using trace gas analyzers and the closed chamber method during the summers of 2019, 2021 and 2022. Transects were placed across the fields, perpendicular to the ditches, with measurements made in the ditches, and 2, 5, and 15 m from the ditches. Ecosystem scale eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and CH4 were made from August 2019 to 2022. Soil temperature and water table depth (WTD) were also measured.
  
 The fields were sources of CO2 and small sinks to sources of CH4. Ditch CO2 and CH4 fluxes were two and seven times, respectively, those from the fields. Emissions peaked during late summer, and there was limited interannual variability. Soil temperature and WTD were important controls of CO2 and CH4 emissions from the fields. In the ditches, we observed significantly higher CO2 emissions during periods with no standing water. These results will aid in modeling site management scenarios, and support our understanding of peatland heterotrophic respiration.
