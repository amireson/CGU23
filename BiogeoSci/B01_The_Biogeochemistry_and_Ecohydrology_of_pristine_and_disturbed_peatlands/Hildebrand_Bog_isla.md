Peatlands are diverse ecosystems that play an important role in the global carbon cycle and in regulation of local and regional water flows. Understanding the allogenic and autogenic factors that stimulate bog formation will allow for a greater understanding of how land use and climate changes may impact these systems. This may also help in understanding formation factors of small bogs compared to those of larger bogs. Little research has been done on small scale (70-120 metre diameter) bogs commonly appearing as ‘islands’ in larger fens. Data were collected from two orthogonal transects installed across each of nine small bogs of varying size throughout a large fen complex in southeastern Manitoba (Moss Spur). Each transect consisted of 8-13 wells (based on bog size) and 2-3 piezometers to measure water table position, hydraulic conductivity, and hydraulic gradients. Peat depth, clay elevation, and water chemistry data were also collected throughout the study area. The goal of the research is to examine these factors to explore their impact on bog formation. Preliminary results show the characteristic doming nature of the water table from fen to bog on average and hydraulic conductivity decreasing with an increase in depth, as expected. A slight depression(~5cm) was found in the clay surface underlying the studied bogs, possibly creating an environment that favoured small bog formation. By studying the factors, influencing what seems to be spontaneous bog formation throughout fens, ubiquitous in the region, would allow us to better understand the conditions that favour bog development.
