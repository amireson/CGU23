Northern peatlands store ~500 Pg C and are important ecosystems for global climate regulation. Wildfire is the largest natural disturbance to peatlands within the Boreal Plains of western Canada. Historically, low severity fires in this region release less carbon than accumulates over a fire return interval (~120 years), allowing peatlands to maintain their carbon sink function. While peat combustion (measured as depth of burn) is typically low ranging from 5-10 cm releasing up to 3 kg C m-2, during prolonged drought or in drained peatlands peat burn severity can reach depths >1 m releasing up to 85 kg C m-2, threatening the carbon sink function of boreal peatlands. Here we examine the burn severity of natural (pristine) and drained portions of a peatland complex that burned during a wildfire in 2021. Landscape factors (i.e., location relative to adjacent upland ecosystems), peat depth, distance to drainage ditch, and above ground fuel loading characteristics are considered as potential ecohydrological controls on peat combustion. Initial analyses show that distance to ditch, pre-fire peat depth, and above ground fuel loading exhibit strong controls on peat burn severity, and that drained peatland margins (close to adjacent uplands) experience the greatest peat burn severity. Additionally, we find that overall average depth of burn from this fire is high compared to the typical low peat burn severity experienced by pristine peatlands in the region, even in undrained peatland middles, suggesting that the impacts of peatland drainage and/or drought are greater than originally hypothesized.
