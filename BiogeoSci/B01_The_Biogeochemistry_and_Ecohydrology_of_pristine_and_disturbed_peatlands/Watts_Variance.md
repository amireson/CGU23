Peatlands take millennia to reach equilibrium, accumulating peat (and therefore
 carbon) slowly over time. Peatland models and peat core samples can be used to estimate the
 rate of peat and carbon accumulation for generalised and specific sites, respectively. The
 comparison between simulated and measured accumulation values can both evaluate
 simulations and place the measured peatland in context for empirical studies.
 Our research aims to: (1) assess the variance between simulated and measured (from
 core samples) peat and carbon accumulation data; and (2) evaluate our peatland
 environmental systems model for use in studies of extraction.
 We have measured the density, age (14C), normalised depth and carbon percentage of
 peat samples taken in Eastern Quebec autumn 2022 using a Russian corer. These values
 enabled us to estimate the carbon accumulation rate of our study site over the past 8000
 years. Our environmental systems model approximates peat accumulation in peat systems and
 is currently being adjusted to the addition of a hydrological sub-model. Our model allows for
 a range of carbon percentage and density to be used, in order to infer simulated peatland
 carbon accumulation. We will consequently be able to assess the similarity between
 measured carbon accumulation and simulated carbon accumulation rates, which will validate
 our environmental systems model.
 Peat and carbon accumulation rates demonstrate a variation over time, with fastest
 accumulation occurring in the youngest samples (pre-3000 years old) and slower
 accumulation in the oldest samples (post-6000 years old) for the field measured site. The
 mean accumulation rate for the measured site is approximately 24 g C m-2 y-1, which is
 similar to values reported in the literature. Our environmental systems model demonstrates a
 similar trend of age to carbon accumulation, simulating mean carbon accumulation as 23.7 g
 C m-2 y-1, with sensitivity to input density and carbon percentage.
 Our results will be used as a building block to infer when net-zero biospheric carbon
 emissions and carbon neutral conditions can be reached in future research, according to
 peatland extraction and management.
