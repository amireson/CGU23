As peatlands undergo extraction, their hydrological regime is altered by the creation of drainage channels leading to shifts in the carbon dynamics. The objective of this research is to examine how the changes in peatland hydrology affect the transportation of DOC in an actively extracted peatland nested within a larger intact peatland, located in Eastern Quebec. Therefore, our aim is to track the movement of DOC as it is transported through the drainage network and identify the contribution of DOC from natural and extracted peatland sites using a combination of 13C-DOC and 2H-H2O measurements using a two-way mixing model. 
 Samples of water were taken continuously and periodically from May 2022 to October 2022 at multiple locations to assess the spatial and temporal variabilities of DOC throughout the study site. The various sample types included: soil moisture water, precipitation, groundwater, and stream water. 
 Currently, the water samples are being filtered and analyzed for their DOC concentrations. The 13C-DOC and 2H-H2O data will then be measured and used to identify the origins of the DOC and water entering the drainage channels. 
 We anticipate 13C-DOC and 2H-H2O signatures present in the ditches will be primarily influenced by the extracted portion of the peatlands and as such, will show similar signatures. Consequently, this would insinuate that majority of DOC content present in the ditches is originating from the extracted sites. 
 This research will aid in our understanding of the movement of DOC through an extracted peatland and the overall cycling of carbon.
