Shallow peatlands in the eastern Georgian Bay region are critical habitat for species at-risk reptiles, and are subject to climate change, wildfire, and development pressures. However, shallow peatlands are generally understudied despite widespread coverage across the Boreal Shield ecoregion. The hydrological, geochemical and ecological functions of these shallow peatlands often differ from their deep counterparts, particularly those considered geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs). Moreover, shallow peatlands may represent earlier stages in peatland development where autogenic hydrological feedbacks are less well developed, affecting their resilience to drying and wildfire. Among these are two interconnected feedbacks, namely the WT-deformation and WT-specific yield feedback, whereby the effect of water table (WT) fluctuations is moderated by the expansion and compression of peat to reduce the distance from surface to WT and alter hydraulic properties transiently. To better understand the importance of peat depth on peatland resilience we examined the controls on WT dynamics at over 20 peatlands of varying peat depth from 2016 to 2022. This dataset has been analyzed to assess the influence of wetland and catchment level characteristics, particularly on metrics of ecohydrological significance such as hydroperiod. The seasonal variation in peat deformation has also been measured given its relevance to peat water storage to discern if the strength of this feedback varies by peatland depth or other variables. Our findings have implications to inform assessments of peatland vulnerability to drying and wildfire and the restoration design of more resilient habitats.
