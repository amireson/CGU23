Seismic lines are linear corridors constructed across northwestern Canada in peatlands and forests for petroleum exploration. They can significantly affect hydrology, wildlife habitat use, and vegetation communities. Previous studies have shown that plant community composition changes following seismic line disturbance. However, it remains unclear how this compositional change affects plant community functions. The objectives of this study were to determine 1) if plant community functions are different on the seismic lines versus in undisturbed peatland, and 2) whether newly disturbed lines differ from recovering lines. We used a plant functional trait approach to investigate potential functional shifts.
 The study was conducted in a rich fen near Conklin, Alberta. Sample plots were distributed across four site types: undisturbed, disturbed 20 years ago, recently disturbed (in the winter prior to sampling), disturbed twice (once 20 years ago and once recently). We measured plant composition and plant functional traits (e.g., plant height, leaf size, leaf nutrient content) on 17 dominant plant species, including mosses, shrubs, forbs, sedges, horsetails, and trees.
 Preliminary results indicate that seismic line disturbance has a wide range of effects on plants. Some plant species have traits that give them competitive advantage to colonize and grow in the disturbed areas, while other species have the traits that allow them to grow better in the undisturbed areas. Results from this study will improve our understanding on seismic line functional recovery in peatlands, helping to inform restoration planning.
