In the eastern Boreal Shield ecozone, shallow peatlands are susceptible to severe smouldering combustion due to deep WT drawdown and occasional WT loss during dry periods. Wildfire frequency and severity are predicted to increase with climate change in the boreal region as warmer temperatures will likely lead to drier conditions in peatlands which lack stomatal control over evaporative losses. Peatland CO2 exchange is altered post-fire due to a loss of vegetation, changes in peat quantity/quality, and changes in water balance. However, the trajectory of ecosystem recovery may be affected by differences in ecohydrological feedbacks associated with peat depth. To better understand the response of these shallow peatlands to wildfire, we measured ecosystem-scale CO2 exchange following an ~11,000 ha wildfire using the eddy covariance method. CO2 fluxes, WT dynamics, and vegetation recovery were monitored for four years post-wildfire. A detailed flux footprint analysis was used to parse flux contributions from the different surface cover types in the study area. Within two years post-wildfire, a burned deep peatland in the flux footprint was an apparent CO2 sink during the growing season. However, the sink status of a shallow severely burned peatland was near-neutral over the study period, with inter-annual variability in net CO2 exchange being linked to growing season precipitation. While deep peatlands on the Boreal Shield appear to be ecohydrologically resilient to wildfire under contemporary conditions, the post-fire state of shallow severely burned peatlands suggests they may only recover the loss of legacy carbon under wet conditions and long fire intervals.
