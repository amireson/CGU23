Wetlands are classified as areas with a relatively high water table and mostly saturated soils during the year. More specifically, temperate swamps are minerogenous in nature and are one of the most abundant wetland types in southern Ontario. The unique hydroperiod of this ecosystem supports dense woody vegetation and litter inputs that are a major source of organic matter and nutrients to swamp soils. Swamp ecosystems play an important role in carbon sequestration and can act as a nature-based solution to climate change. Despite the importance of swamps, they are one of the most understudied classes of wetlands in Canada. Litterfall quantities increase in swamps that are highly productive, peaking during the fall season. We designed a 4-month study of 12 swamps in southern Ontario during the fall season and collected, dried, and weighed litterfall samples before conducting a carbon to nitrogen ratio analysis. Total litterfall collected at each site ranged from 223 to 377 g/m2, with significantly higher amounts in deciduous and mixedwood sites than coniferous. Carbon to nitrogen ratios varied from 99:1 to 15:1 amongst swamp sites, indicating that there are varying rates of litter lability and nutrient content returning to swamp soils. One possible explanation for the observed variance is the difference in tree species composition among sampling sites. These findings offer meaningful insight into nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration abilities in swamp ecosystems, expanding the range of scientific evidence regarding swampsâ€™ ability to successfully be a nature-based solution for climate change.
