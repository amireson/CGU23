By removing vegetation, installing drainage ditches and harvesting peat, peat extraction changes the hydrological and thermal regimes of the peatlands, which makes the peatlands a strong source of CO2 emissions. We have adopted the CoupModel (www.coupmodel.com) to simulate the soil CO2 emissions and its associated ecohydrological drivers for an ongoing extraction site, located in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec. COUP was first evaluated against three-year (2018-2021) manual chamber measurements of CO2 flux, multi-layered soil moisture and temperature profile, and water table depth data. The validated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of climate on the simulated CO2 emissions. COUP reproduced the measured summer CO2 flux data and simulated the hydrology and thermal conditions well. We further performed a long-term (1994-2021) simulation using available climate data from the nearby station. The simulated 27-year results show emissions from a typical continental bog that have been extracted for 15 years under a continental climate in eastern Canada would be c.a. 140 (80-190) g CO2-C m-2 yr-1. Our simulated annual CO2 emission rate, for the studied field, is about half of the Tier 1 default emission factor 280 (110 - 420) g C m-2 yr-1 provided in the IPCC 2013 wetland supplement, also much lower than current emission factors, 310 g C m-2 yr-1 (by an IPCC Tier 2 methodology) for drained areas used for peat extractions in Canadian national greenhouse gas reporting. Peat restoration by blocking ditches and reintroducing the vegetation back, when extraction will be finished, would change the ecohydrological conditions and reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, we are also applying the model to simulate restorations of earlier peat extraction sites using moss transfer technology.
