Peatlands throughout Canadaâ€™s boreal regions are impacted by the construction of access roads and well pads associated with extractive natural resource industries. Following decommissioning, restoration of peatland ecosystem function on these sites is required. Complete pad or road removal has shown promise as a technique to support bog vegetation initiation, but results in conditions which are not optimized for fen vegetation initiation. Accordingly, the introduction of true fen mosses directly onto cation-rich mineral substrates has been proposed as an alternative. We assessed hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics on a remnant mineral substrate recently created through partial removal of a well pad and on an intact road, which had undergone 25 years of natural revegetation near Slave Lake, Alberta. Comparisons between the two features were used to inform the possible trajectory of biogeochemical processes on recently exposed or decommissioned mineral substrates. Soil moisture and biogeochemical dynamics on the remnant pad were governed by the degree of hydrological connectivity with adjacent peatlands, and conditions on this feature tended towards those expected of extreme-rich fens immediately post-decommissioning. On the road, development of a sedge litter layer contributed to consistent maintenance of soil moisture conditions suitable for fen moss initiation and improved nutrient availability compared to the pad. Depletion of the road exchangeable cation content indicates a shift towards moderate-rich fen conditions on mineral substrates over the long-term. Overall, it appears the development of sedge litter layers on mineral substrates supports the development of soil moisture and biogeochemical conditions favourable for establishment of fen mosses.
