A warmer climate is driving wildfires to occur more frequently and severely, releasing carbon (C) stored in biomass and soil as greenhouse gases (GHG), contributing to a changing climate. There's an immediate need to determine how wildfires impact the environment, specifically how wildfires affect northern peatland C storage. Peatlands are globally significant sinks of C; however, disturbance from fire causes an efflux of C. It's unknown how different peatland types recover, specifically in terms of C fluxes and vegetation. Most research is focused on precipitation-fed bogs, and little is known about whether recovery in groundwater-fed fens is comparable, despite fens accounting for most peatlands in western Canada. Thus, the objectives of the study are to examine differences in (i) C fluxes and (ii) vegetation communities between a fen and a bog, 6 years after fire. A bog and a fen, both affected by wildfire in 2016, were instrumented to collect data on CO¬2 and vegetation communities across a fire severity gradient. Results show that following 6 years of recovery, fire decreases a bog’s capacity to uptake CO2 but has minimal effect on CO2 cycling in a fen. The results, combined with existing studies on GHG exchange from undisturbed peatlands, can inform models of longer-term peatland C cycling that include fire return intervals and inform inclusion of peatland-climate feedbacks in earth system models. Understanding recovery of peatland function following natural disturbances also provides a baseline trajectory for ecosystem development to be used as a reference following restoration and reclamation.
