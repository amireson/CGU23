Phosphorus is a component of important biomolecules such as DNA or ATP. This makes it an essential nutrient for plants in soils, but at the same time it is often the limiting nutrient for plant growth. Peatlands are sensitive to fluctuations in their nutrient cycling and nutrient limitations, which can lead to changes in plant cover or decomposition rates. Peatlands are particularly important in terms of their effect on climate and biodiversity. Further research on phosphorus as a limiting nutrient is needed to better understand the mechanisms triggering ecosystem responses. 
 
 Enzymes play a key role in the phosphorus cycle in the availability and uptake of phosphorus, which is bound in soil as orthophosphate (PO4). During these processes, oxygen atoms can be exchanged and alter the isotope ratios in different reservoirs. Using oxygen isotope signatures as tracers allows to study the underlying exchange processes in greater detail and in a more natural setting than using radio isotopes of phosphorus. This poster presents the concept of enzymatic oxygen exchange processes and the potential of utilizing all three stable isotopes of oxygen. These new insights gained from isotope ratio mass spectrometry have the potential to improve our knowledge of ecosystem changes in peatlands to avoid negative impacts on climate and biodiversity.
