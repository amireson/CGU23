Increased fertilizer application driven by a growing food demand in the Indian agricultural landscapes has altered biogeochemical processes in agroecosystems. As a result, enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (a potent greenhouse gas causing global warming) in these systems, mandating their quantification. However, the previous attempts that quantified N2O emissions through a bottom-up approach were short-term and utilized country-level and crop-generalized emission factors (EFs). Hence, they may not explicitly represent the spatiotemporal variations of N­2O emissions. To comprehensively fill this gap and assess the N2O emissions dynamics in the long term (1966-2017) at the district level across India, we created district- and crop-specific N2O EFs from 82 field plot studies with 861 observations across 13 locations. Using these refined EFs (specific for synthetic fertilizer, animal manure, and crop residue return), we calculated district-level emissions from 1966 to 2017 and analyzed significant spatiotemporal drivers. Total N2O emissions increased from 73.7 ± 3.3 Gg to 279.3 ± 15.8 Gg from 1966 to 2017 due to increased crop production (4.1 Tg yr-1) driven by increased fertilization (0.3 Tg yr-1). This growth was synchronous with emissions from synthetic fertilizer, animal manure, crop residue return, soil organic matter, volatilization, and leaching and runoff. At a national scale, N2O emissions from synthetic fertilization were the most significant (57%) in 2017, followed by animal manure (15%) and soil organic matter (9%). However, emissions from animal manure and crop residue return were also dominant at the district level due to the usage of refined EFs. This study is the first to analyze long-term N2O emissions at the district level in Indian agricultural soils with less uncertainty (5.1%). The results of this study may benefit stakeholders and policymakers in understanding the hot spots and moments of N2O emissions for intervention measures across India.
