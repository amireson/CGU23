Wetland ecosystems are large carbon sinks but at the same time also emit greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). A greater understanding of wetland greenhouse gas production is required to determine the overall impact of wetland conversion and restoration. This project focuses on the heterogeneity of greenhouse gas production within a mineral wetland near Atocas Bay in southern Ontario. We analyzed spatial and seasonal variations of dissolved greenhouse gases and explore how water column depth and water chemistry affect observed differences. Our preliminary results show that there is a strong effect of seasonality with a positive correlation between water temperature and dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations. This observation is explained by the acceleration of aerobic respiration with warmer temperatures leading to higher production rates of CO2. Increases in CH4 are likely due to the more rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen with warmer temperatures, resulting in reducing conditions and methanogenesis. Spatially, we find a positive correlation between water depth and dissolved CH4 concentrations, due to reducing conditions closer to the bottom of the wetland. When testing the effect of water chemistry, we found a strong positive correlation between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved CO2 concentrations, which is expected as DOC is a substrate for the production of CO2. These preliminary results agree with previous findings in the literature on mineral wetland greenhouse gas emissions.
