Stormwater management ponds are ubiquitous landscape features in the recently-built suburban environment, accepting runoff from nearby impervious surfaces, delaying transport to downstream water courses. This in principal also traps sediment and all sundry of urban nasties from entering hopefully healthy streams. While some work has quantified whether these SWM ponds are actually good at minimizing water quality degradation in the stream, most research has focussed on growing season months. In the spirit of this session we will remove our ecohydrologist hats for this talk, pretend to be biogeochemists not yet comfortable labelling ourselves limnologists, and discuss the nutrient transformations going on in our campus SWM pond over a 16-month period. The receiving waters to this pond contained nitrogen as mostly nitrate (~80 %), but a mix of phosphate (40 %), dissolved organic phosphorus (20 %), and particulate phosphorus (40 %). The N and P in the water leaving the pond were primarily in the particulate (60 %) and dissolved organic (35 %) forms. Total P concentrations in and out of the pond were higher during cold periods, and yes, levels leaving the pond were higher than those washed in from the campus. These trends did not hold for total N. This resulted in the N:P ratio of the water through the pond switching from P-limited (41:1) to N-limited (6:1) upon discharge. Thus, the water leaving this pond is more likely to lead to downstream algal blooms and lower dissolved oxygen than if that water didnâ€™t move through the pond.
