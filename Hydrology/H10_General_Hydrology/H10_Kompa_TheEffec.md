Groundwater-surface water interactions are very important for the accurate assessment of surface water budgets at different scales. In areas with shallow groundwater, complicated geological settings, seasonally frozen soils and mixed precipitation during the cold season, a significant proportion of streamflow may originate from deep groundwater or percolate down to deep groundwater. 
 Most watershed scale hydrological models such as (GEM)-Hydro, MESH, CRHM, SUMMA, PRMS, RAVEN, and SWAT deal with surface water and shallow groundwater but do not consider the interactions with deeper groundwater. In this study, we developed a simplified model agnostic baseflow module (BaseFlow-Aquifer Storage and Conductance Based, bf_ascb) that was tested in MESH. This model assesses the net groundwater interactions (GWNIO) time series. It assumes that the bias in simulated local streamflow originates from a multitude of possible and undiscernible interactions with the groundwater aquifer. Total runoff to the stream for each grid is derived directly from the vertical water budget surface and interflow estimation to the stream. The lower zone aquifer contribution to the local streamflow is modified by the GWNIO parameters to adjust for systematic biases in the streamflow simulation at the local level. In order to evaluate these local biases for streamflow simulations, we employed the MESH model and optimized the routing parameters to route the corrected and de-biased local streamflow along the stream channels. The results show an improvement in the bias and the timing of the flow estimate when compared with observations and with the benchmark model run without the GWNIO parametrization.
