According to both theory and climate models, an increase in future rainfall extremes is expected with global warming. However, the impact on common (annual) and rare (decennial or centennial) extremes could differ. We have conducted a study using 25 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, considering a range of plausible scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions, to study how common and rare extremes are projected to change in the future. Our findings show that the rarer the event, the more likely it is to increase in a future climate. Specifically, we have found that by the end of this century, daily land rainfall extremes could increase in magnitude between 10.5% and 28.2% for annual events, and between 13.5% and 38.3% for centennial events, respectively for low and high emission scenarios. These results are consistent across climate models, although regional variations are evident. For Canadian provinces and territories, we find consistently that the rarest extremes increase the most. The magnitude of this increase is not uniform, with relatively higher increase in the north, and lower increase around the prairies.
