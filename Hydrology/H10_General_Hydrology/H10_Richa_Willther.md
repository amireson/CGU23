“Unnamed Lake” in Nunavut’s capital city of Iqaluit represents the community’s best hope for a reliable freshwater supply that will meet the communities rapidly growing water demands. The lake has already been used once as a source for emergency resupply of Iqaluit’s municipal surface water reservoir. It is now being seriously considered for its potential as a longer-term supply. This is a relatively large and deep lake for the area, thus drawing attention as a promising future water source for the community, yet little is known about the renewable fraction of water that it offers. This issue has been compounded by a virtually impossible-to-gauge lake outflow, a problem that can only be solved through installation of a massive weir with major financial investment and significant delays due to water licensing requirements. Fortunately, we have collected some preliminary information on the major water balance terms of this lake, from spring to fall of 2022 . This presentation will highlight results from terrestrial and open-water eddy covariance measurements, precipitation inputs including end-of-winter snow water equivalent estimates available for recharge, and an indirect estimate of outflow discharge derived by gauging multiple downstream locations. These observations represent the first available hydrologic observations to help answer the questions: Will there be enough water for Iqaluit? And if so, for how long will it last, given the Arctic city’s current growth trajectory?
