Seismic lines are linear corridors cleared of vegetation to facilitate resource exploration. The accessibility provided for heavy machinery can cause soil compaction, resulting in ecosystem disturbances. Where seismic lines cross peatlands they can alter soil properties, moisture conditions and can increase carbon release to the atmosphere, though the extent of these impacts varies depending on ecosystem type. Previous studies have found that the bulk density of soils is increased on seismic lines crossing peatlands, which likely has implications for the movement of water through the soils. However, the effect of seismic lines on other soil properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, has not been measured. Additionally, the removal of the vegetation canopy during seismic line clearing likely alters local over-winter snow accumulation patterns and water availability during the spring freshet; however, these alterations to the local hydrological conditions have yet to be considered. This project evaluates the effects of seismic line formation on the local hydrology and soil properties in different ecosystem types. Detailed topographic surveys identified a lower surface elevation and reduced depth to water table on seismic lines compared to the adjacent natural area. The associated soil compaction increased soil bulk density and decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity. Snow accumulation was found to increase on seismic lines, however increased snow density on the line drove the observed 30% increase in the total water stored within the over-winter snowpack on the seismic line as compared to the adjacent ecosystem.
