Wetlands play a vital role in the environment as they store large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, reduce the flood effects, and hydrologically interact with the surrounding upslope area through the lateral exchange of groundwater. Land Surface Models (LSMs) simulate the different components of the hydrological cycle; however, some processes, such as groundwater-surface water interactions and landscape elements, such as wetlands, are either missing or poorly represented. This problem can lead to inaccuracy in simulating fluxes such as streamflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we explore different possible parametrizations to describe wetland-groundwater-upland interactions with varying levels of modeling complexity. We perform numerical experiments to represent the possible ways of simulating the interaction between uplands, groundwater, and wetlands 1) no interaction (uncoupled), 2) one-way interaction (Chained), and 3) two-way interaction (fully coupled). We provide insights into the appropriate modeling approaches depending on the land cover, soil type, upland-wetland configuration, and the ultimate modeling purpose.
