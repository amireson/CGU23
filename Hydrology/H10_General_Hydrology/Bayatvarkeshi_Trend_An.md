Weather variable patterns play a critical role as drivers of ecosystem function. Upward or downward trend of each variable can drive the parameters associated with climate change. The main purpose of this investigation is evaluation of weather variablesâ€™ trends in two different regions in Canada. For this goal, data from meteorological stations of Fort McMurray and Edmonton, AB for a 25-year period from 1997 to 2021 were assessed. The trend analysis was carried out with Mann-Kendall (MK) test as one of strong statistical tests in temporal variation of physical parameters. The weather variables included minimum, maximum, and mean temperature (Tmin, Tmax, Tmean), total precipitation, snow on ground, cooling and heating degree days. The results indicated that there is a downward trend for Tmin, Tmax, Tmean in both stations; however, the decreasing trend of Tmax in Fort McMurray was significant in 95% confidence level. The noticeable finding is that there was an upward trend in amount of snow on ground in both zones; whereas this increasing pattern was significant in 99% confidence level in Fort McMurray compared to Edmonton. However, the total snow in Edmonton has increased significantly over the past 25 years. In terms of heating and cooling degree, a nonsignificant rise was observed in both areas.
