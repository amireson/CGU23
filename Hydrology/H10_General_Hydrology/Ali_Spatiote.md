Countless studies have performed event-based hyetograph-hydrograph analyses to gain insights on runoff and streamflow generation in response to precipitation events. However, most of these studies focused on small, experimental forested catchments, thereby neglecting larger watersheds with heterogeneous land use and various degrees of human impact. Furthermore, event-scale studies are largely biased toward rainfall-runoff analyses, thereby ignoring snowmelt and rain-on-snow events susceptible to generate significant flow in Northern latitudes. The goal of the present study was, therefore, to examine runoff and flow generation in contrasted watersheds, by (1) documenting hydrologic responses to individual rain-only, snowmelt-only, and rain-on-snow events, (2) assessing the predictability of hydrologic response from landscape characteristics. The focus was on the Lake Erie Basin (LEB), specifically on 140 watersheds (1.8 to 16,410 km2) located in the Canadian and the American portions of the LEB. Daily gridded climate data and gauged streamflow data spanning 2000-2019 were used, resulting in the identification and analysis of over 30,000 precipitation-runoff events. Preliminary results show that the drivers of hydrologic response were highly variable in space and time, with high-magnitude and high-flashiness responses being predominantly triggered by rain-on-snow events in some watersheds, and rather rain-only events in others. Watershed drainage area, slope, topsoil clay and organic carbon content, and cropland area are among the landscape characteristics identified as statistically significant controls of the observed spatial patterns in hydrologic response. The proposed presentation will include an overview of these results, and their implications for flooding and nutrient export potential in the LEB.
