The landscape of the Canadian Prairies is unique as the area is dominated by streams, lakes, and wetlands that are unconnected during normal conditions. They do, however, become connected when there is an abundance of water in the system. High water availability typically occurs during periods of snowmelt and increased precipitation. This poses a challenge for those who live in the area regarding water management. This has also been a region of significant hydrological regulation of the major waterways, which has impacted the natural flow of the rivers. The complex hydrological regimes of the prairies has made it difficult to model the hydrology of the area, which is why first hand verification is needed.
 
 SLCN is a First Nation situated in this region and has an oral tradition that predates any modern hydrological regulation. A 2D hydraulic model was created for the area surrounding SLCN using HEC-RAS. It was populated using open source Government of Canada data inputs for the hydrological features and daily flow metrics. The Copernicus Digital Elevation Model was used to determine the terrain of the area. The model was set up using open source data and fine-tuned using community knowledge. Flood inundation maps were generated for recent flood and drought events, as well as historical simulations focused on upstream regulation.
