This study evaluated the effects of climate perturbations on snowmelt, soil moisture and streamflow generation in small Canadian Prairie basins using a basin classification–based virtual modelling approach. Seven basin classes that encompass the entirety of the Prairie ecozone in Canada were determined by cluster analysis of biophysical characteristics. Class-specific semi-distributed virtual basin (VB) models were parameterised in the physically based flexible Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) platform, which includes modules to represent the processes important to Prairie Hydrology and can be parameterised to represent the region’s largely agricultural land use, variable contributing area and depressional storage dynamics. Precipitation (P) and temperature (T) perturbation scenarios covering the range of climate model predictions for the 21st century were used to evaluate climate sensitivity of hydrological processes in the seven basin classes representing the Prairie ecozone. Jointly influenced by land cover and local climate, snow accumulation was more sensitive to T in the drier and grassland-characterized basins than in the wetter and cropland dominated ones, whilst soil moisture was most sensitive to T and P perturbations in basins typified by pothole depressions and broad river valleys. Annual streamflow was most sensitive to T and P in the dry and poorly connected Interior Grassland basins and least sensitive in the wet and well-connected Southern Manitoba basins. These results can be used 1) to identify regions and basin typologies which have the largest hydrological sensitivities to changing climate; and 2) diagnose the underlying processes responsible for hydrological responses to expected climate change.
