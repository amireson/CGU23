Swamp-peatlands have been identified as important ecosystems for freshwater generation within the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), where catchments with a higher proportion of swamp-peatlands demonstrated higher runoff. This study provides an initial assessment of hydrological connectivity among the swamp-peatland and adjacent forest ecosystems and relates this to runoff generation within a 12.4 km2 in the WBP of northern Alberta. Considering the importance of headwater reaches for water generation, it is especially important to understand what controls water movement in swamp-peatland systems and runoff in these water-limited regions. Transects of wells and piezometers throughout the swamp-peatland and adjacent forests indicate varying levels and direction of hydrological connectivity, including seasonal horizontal flow reversals. Streamflow measurements were collected to determine if area-normalized runoff is occurring across the site, which can be supported by vertical gradient calculations and water table trends over the season. The results provide new insight into hydrological process, hydrological connectivity and freshwater generation mechanisms operating at the site, which help with the understanding of the function of swamp-peatlands and the varying runoff role in water-limited regions.
