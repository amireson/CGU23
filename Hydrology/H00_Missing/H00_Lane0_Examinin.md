The Arctic region is warming at four times the pace of the global average, leading to a rapid loss of snow and ice cover in recent years. Cryospheric monitoring includes satellite imagery, modelling, and ground-based observations. Ground-based automated cameras provide the ability for in situ monitoring at study sites that generally have poor accessibility. The overall aim of this study was to maximize the usage of field imagery for snow and ice studies within the context of the changing Arctic climate. This study was focused on monitoring snow and lake ice at five study lakes near Resolute and Nanuit Itillinga, Nunavut in the Central Canadian High Arctic with data from 2016-2022. A feasible method for snow and ice data quantification from in situ digital imagery was developed, and the recent variability in phenology was examined. A semi-automated technique using image classification tools was used for tracking the progression of snow redistribution and ice formation across the lakes. Current work is comparing these results to the long-term snow and climate records as well as existing ice phenology records from Resolute Lake to see how the recent years compare to past records. The significance of this research worked to develop an accessible methodology using automated cameras to assess Arctic climate change through integrating in situ data with remote sensing tools. The results from this study provided critical insight into the spatial conditions of cryosphere elements under the present climate state, which will support better projections for future responses to climate change.
