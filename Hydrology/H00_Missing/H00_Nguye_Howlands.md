The Niaqunguk (Apex) River watershed (63°45’N, 68°33’W) is located east of Iqaluit, the capital city of Nunavut, and holds cultural and environmental significance for the community. Increasing climate-induced permafrost degradation is impacting dissolved organic matter (DOM) export from Arctic catchments, with implications for aquatic ecosystem function and thus northern communities. The influence of landscape characteristics (e.g., surficial geology, vegetation, topography) on producing spatially heterogeneous hydrochemical signatures across a watershed is a burgeoning area of research. An improved understanding of the factors affecting water chemistry in Arctic rivers will advance our ability to anticipate future changes to stream biogeochemistry due to shifts in current climatic and environmental conditions. To address this gap, a series of sampling wells and piezometers were installed at three stream reaches and their adjacent hillslopes of differing surficial geologies, vegetation, with stream and groundwater samples retrieved throughout Jun – Aug 2022 to characterize how seasonal hydrological changes and sites of varying landscape characteristics affect the water chemistry in the Niaqunguk River watershed. Physicochemical measurements (e.g., temperature, pH, major ions) were collected. Excitation/emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy coupled with ion and stable water isotope analysis will be used to determine the DOM composition of water samples. Augmented rainfall and groundwater volumes in Arctic catchments as a consequence of climate change may be beneficial for the Niaqunguk River by enhancing water supply during low flows but identifying the baseline conditions and how hydrological changes may impact water quality is critical for understanding changes and informing future water management strategies.
