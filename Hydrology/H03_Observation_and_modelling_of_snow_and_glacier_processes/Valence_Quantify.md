Due to climate change, mountains and arctic environment are warming faster than the global average, leading to rapid alteration to environmental and hydrologic systems. Snowmelt is a critical contributor to the outflow of northern and mountainous catchments, making snow a key hydrologic driver for regional water resources. The research objective is to understand the local controls on snowmelt processes in a subarctic alpine headwater catchment, and to understand the partitioning of snowmelt between surface runoff and groundwater recharge.
 Our study focusses on the Shar Ta Gà’ (Grizzly Creek) research site, a subarctic catchment in the Kluane Mountains, southwest Yukon Territory. Although the valley has glaciers, debris-covered glaciers, rock glaciers, permafrost, and seasonal snow cover, there is no significant nor perennial surface water outflow. Therefore, most of the watershed outflow is hypothesized to occur as groundwater. From June 14 to June 20, 2022, a multimethod fieldwork approach was used to characterize melting of the snowpack, including the impact of boulders that became uncovered as the snow melted. We combine terrestrial time-lapse Lidar, time-lapse thermal imagery, structure from motion photogrammetry, ground penetrating radar, and manual snow surveys to quantify the energy transfer from boulders to adjacent snow surfaces and measure the distributed ablation. 
 The preliminary results show higher surface temperature on the snow adjacent to the emerging boulder which could be a proxy for higher melting rate.
 The findings will provide an improved understanding of seasonal snow melt in northern mountain catchment, with implications for mountain groundwater recharge, hydrologic modelling and forecasting.
