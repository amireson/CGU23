As temperatures continue to rise in the Canadian Arctic, there is growing concern regarding freshwater quality and quantity and the impact of permafrost thaw to these systems. This project focuses on the hydrological effects of climate-induced permafrost thaw in Eureka, Nunavut. In July 2022, two streams (Station Creek and Blacktop Creek) were sampled daily for geochemistry, oxygen isotopes, dissolved organic carbon and solute load. Three Solinst Levelogger 5 LTC data loggers were deployed in each stream; loggers were situated above and below an active thaw slump as well as near the stream outlet. The loggers record water temperature, level and conductivity at 30-minute intervals. A daily manual reading of the site’s pH, temperature, and conductivity was recorded to supplement the logger data. Preliminary results show a quick response of both watersheds to the heavy rain event experienced July 14-15, 2022 (8.4mm over 28 hours). Average discharge for July 7-19th for Station and Blacktop creeks is 0.77 +-0.53 m3/s and 0.59+-0.57 m3/s, respectively. Average d18O for Station and Blacktop creeks is very similar: -23.7+-0.13‰ and -23.6+-0.13‰, respectively. Daily d18O samples range between -25 to -21‰ over the study period, with a ~3‰ depletion after the rain event. The average D-excess for Station and Blacktop creek at 2.5 and 2.4, respectively. Results of this project will be used to understand the proportion of moisture sources (rain, snow melt, and ground ice melt) to these two streams and how these sources will evolve with ongoing climate change in the Arctic.
