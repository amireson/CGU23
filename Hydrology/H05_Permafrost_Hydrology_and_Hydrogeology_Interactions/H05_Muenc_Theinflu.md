Permafrost thaw is a complex environmental challenge, carrying severe implications for both natural and human systems. It is well known that rising temperatures contribute to permafrost degradation, however there is ambiguity on how shifting precipitation patterns will influence permafrost thaw. Specifically, it remains unclear how soil moisture patterns and flowing water alter ground temperatures across diverse permafrost landscapes. To assist in this understanding, the objective of this research is to examine the contributions of advective and latent heat on active layer freeze-thaw dynamics and permafrost temperatures. Field investigations will take place in a representative permafrost hillslope in Baker Creek basin, NWT located within the discontinuous permafrost zone. It is hypothesized that runoff from bedrock uplands induce soil moisture heterogeneity and preferential flow paths which influence ground freeze-thaw processes. Monitoring of soil moisture, ground temperatures, and water movement across the hillslope aims to reveal areas most susceptible to permafrost thaw. This work will assist in creating a conceptual model for the mechanisms of permafrost thaw in the region, and improve our understanding of variable soil moisture patterns on freeze-thaw dynamics. Findings will help inform process representation in models to improve predictions of hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes under future permafrost states.
