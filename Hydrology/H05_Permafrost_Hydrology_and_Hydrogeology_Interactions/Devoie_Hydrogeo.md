More than half of the global terrestrial surface is subject to freezing processes, either as seasonally frozen soils, or as permafrost. Soil freezing processes are governed by the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFCC) that relates the soil temperature to its unfrozen water content. Unfortunately, SFCCs are frequently misrepresented in models, and chosen based on model convergence behavior as opposed to physical soil properties. As climate warms, and midwinter melt events become more common, SFCCs are becoming increasingly important in accurately predicting the hydrological response of catchments.
 
 Two hillslope studies, one for a permafrost system and one for a permafrost-free system affected by seasonal freezing, are modelled using SUTRA-ICE and a selection of widely accepted SFCCs. SFCCs are drawn from literature as well as a repository of collected SFCC data: "A Repository of 100+ Years of Measured Soil Freezing Characteristic Curves". The resulting discharge is compared for each simulation, showing that the choice of SFCC can be an important control on streamflow in these landscapes, and the choice of SFCC may be a previously overlooked controlling process in the hydrological behaviour of catchments with freezing soils. Further work upscaling these results to catchment and larger scales is needed.
