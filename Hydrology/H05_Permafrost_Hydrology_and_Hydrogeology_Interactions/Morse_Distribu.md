Aufeis (a.k.a., icing) is a mass of layered ice in a sheet-like form that develops over winter from successive overflows of water onto frozen ground or ice surfaces from various sources. Aufeis formation, distribution, and dynamics are directly linked hydrological conditions in permafrost regions that are shifting due to climate change. The controls on broad-scale aufeis distribution and dynamics are not well understood beyond a handful of regional and sub regional investigations, which leads to high uncertainty in projecting how aufeis dynamics will be affected by changing climate. Building on insights gained from several recent advances in remote-sensing based aufeis mapping, we are developing a site-agnostic approach to map aufeis with Google Earth Engine. Our goal is to develop an automatic routine to delineate aufeis that can be applied to create regional to national scale datasets of aufeis distribution and dynamics. Here we will present our progress on tool development and our initial findings.
