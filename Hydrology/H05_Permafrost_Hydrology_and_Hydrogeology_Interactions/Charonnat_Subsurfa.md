Proglacial areas, that expand as glaciers are retreating, are made of buried ice and debris features such as rock glaciers and ice-cored moraines. They are potential substantial contributors to baseflow in alpine glacierized catchments. Given the rapid warming in mountain regions, these cryospheric features may potentially buffer losses from diminished snowpacks and retreating glaciers. However, the hydrological behaviour and significance of these complex systems remain poorly known. Their potential entry role to groundwater remains understudied.
 The study catchment for the present study, located in Shar Ta Gà’ (Grizzly Creek), St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, features numerous glacial and periglacial elements. The few visible seepage and springs observed at its outlet are either non-perennial or exhibit unsubstantial discharge. In Summer 2022, 15 springs and water bodies were monitored by pressure transducers and sampled during a synoptic campaign to analyze major ions and water stable isotopes concentrations. 
 The results show that the monitored springs react differently to meteorological events. Ice and permafrost spots have an important impact on the springs’ behaviour. The glacier appears to supply one of the non-perennial springs with meltwater. Transit time for glacier meltwater is increasing towards the end of the summer. The total volume of water flowing through the springs remaining far below yearly catchment precipitation amounts, the catchment is seen as a potential groundwater sink.
 The findings from this study underline the complexity and diversity of subsurface flow paths in expanding proglacial systems. Additionally, it enlightens their role as an intermediate between surface meltwater flow and groundwater.
