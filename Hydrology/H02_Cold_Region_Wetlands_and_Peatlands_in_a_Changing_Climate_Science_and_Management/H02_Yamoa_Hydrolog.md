Ecotones are dynamic and biological communities between two ecosystems that ensure the exchange of energy, water, and nutrients and are typical between bogs and fens. Integrating this concept during the restoration of extracted peatlands and their natural surrounding is not common practise, in part to not being well understood. One recent approach to restore ecotone function is to create slopes on the periphery of the extracted peatland. Data were collected from 8 identified transects from a disturbed peatland site (Moss Spur 2) in southeastern Manitoba. Each transect comprised 6 wells. The instrumentations allowed for the measurement of water table position, hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradients. Peat depths and surface elevation were determined for each transect. After recontouring, water retention strategies were included to improve understanding of hydrological feedback across four experimental designs (5-Pond, 3-Pond, Berm and Control) at three sections (W-ECO, NW-ECO and S-ECO). The result showed that water table was ~30 cm higher at the recontoured sites than non-recontoured. The experimental management approach improved water table conditions especially on the 5-Pond treatment. Improved water table conditions may be vital for the transport of nutrient, water, and energy across the ecotone. Such improved conditions are important for the establishment of fen ecosystems.
