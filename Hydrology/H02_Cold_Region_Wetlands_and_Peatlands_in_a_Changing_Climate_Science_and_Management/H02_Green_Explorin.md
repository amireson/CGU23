As climate change continues, it is expected that there will be an increase in the size, intensity and frequency of wildland fires. This increase is expected to be greatest in the higher latitudes, including Canada’s Boreal Plains Ecozone. Over 40% of the Boreal Plains is covered by peatlands which have high moisture levels and thick deposits of organic soils. As the fire regime intensifies, the area of peatlands that are burning is increasing. One shortcoming of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System is that it has been found to underpredict the fire danger within peatlands under different environmental conditions. This is a challenge for wildland firefighters but also a public safety, environmental and economic concern. 
 Measurements of organic soil thickness indicate that areas of low topographic slope, including peatlands and margins, had generally thicker organic soils (0.4 m to >5 m) that are more prone to saturation than surrounding forested hillslopes (average soil thickness = 0.3 m). Near-surface (0 – 5 cm) moisture content (MC) was uniformly low across landscape positions and landscape class (average = 15 to 25% MC), indicating similar ignition potential across the landscape. Soil moisture at the rooting zone (i.e., 10-20 cm depth) varied with total organic thickness and landscape class indicating substantial spatial variation in smouldering potential and depth of burn throughout the landscape. A better understanding of the distribution and soil moisture regime of organic soils and peatlands will enhance predictions of fire risk and maximize the efficiency of firefighting responses.
