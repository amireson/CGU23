Among the numerous ecosystem services provided by wetlands, climate regulation is identified as one of their most important benefits to society. Wetland ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle; they provide the ideal environment for long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide, yet they are also the largest single source of methane. Climate change has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands, however, the consequences of rising temperatures on wetland GHG exchange remains uncertain. Furthermore, preventing further wetland loss and restoring wetland ecosystems has been identified as important in limiting future emissions to help meet climate goals. This talk presents research that combines field-based measurements, remote sensing, and modelling to provide new insights into the controls of wetland GHG fluxes across a range of spatial and temporal scales and quantify the potential climate benefits of wetland restoration and conservation. Specifically, this work highlights: 1) how peatland restoration via re-wetting can play an important role in climate change mitigation, 2) the role of blue carbon ecosystems as nature-based solutions to climate change, with a focus on tidal marshes along the Pacific Coast of Canada, and 3) and how GHG fluxes from wetlands in agricultural landscapes can be strongly impacted by inputs from the surrounding landscape, which can have a significant impact on regional GHG budgets. This research is important for better predicting current and future contributions of wetlands to climate change, which is highly relevant for policies aiming to limit the level of global temperature rise.
