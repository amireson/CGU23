Models of circumpolar mercury (Hg) storage indicate that the Hudson Bay Lowlands (Canada’s largest wetland) stores a significant amount of Hg (81-150 mg Hg m-2) in the top 0-300 cm of the soil profile. Mercury is a chemical of concern as it speciates into organic methylmercury (MeHg), a neurotoxin that bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic ecosystems. This research seeks to: 1) refine the estimate of Hg storage in the HBL based on field validation and upscaling; and 2) explore the impacts of permafrost thaw on microbial MeHg production in thawing environments. To assess Hg storage in the HBL, we collected 50 peat cores from 39 locations across the HBL, and analyzed subsamples for THg using a Milestone DMA-80 and bulk density following standard methods (n=980). To assess the impacts of permafrost thaw, we analyzed samples from palsas and peat plateaus (abundant permafrost features in the HBL) and newly thawed thermokarst fens (n = 188) for MeHg concentrations following USEPA 1630, and examined microbial community structure using 16s rRNA gene amplification and sequencing from soil eDNA. We found that Hg storage in the region was significantly lower than modelled estimates, with 9.23±1.65 mg Hg m-2 (mean±SD), which translated to ~3.08 Gg of Hg in the HBL. Concentrations of MeHg were significantly higher (p <0.001) in subsamples from thermokarst fens compared to active layer and permafrost samples. There was significant variation in microbial community structure between active layer, permafrost, and thermokarst environments, which potentially relates to higher MeHg concentrations in thermokarst fens.
