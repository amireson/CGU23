Boreal peatlands play an important role in bio-geochemical cycles at the global scale. As climate change impacts increase, there is a growing need to better understand possible future scenarios and tipping points of peatlands, so as to make more accurate predictions of their impacts on bio-geochemical cycles. Thirty-six peatlands were classified according to their vegetation composition of both bryophytes and tracheophytes. These sites then served as models for representing peatlands across the territory. The one dimensional DigiBog model was used and calibrated with the mean values for various parameters as observed in the field (e.g. Water Table Depth, peat thickness, porosity, etc.). The exploratory nature of this project simulated possible future water table depths using climate data as forcing variables made available from the CIMP5 project for two scenarios of future gas emissions (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The general observed trajectory was a higher water table depth by 2100, which represents a transition to more ombrotrophic peatlands and adapted vegetation. At shorter time scales, the model showed a strong resistance to climate extremes with the help of many internal and autogenous processes. However, the increase in the frequency of extreme events could push peatlands across tipping points toward other non wetland habitats. The occurrence and frequency of extreme events over short time scales (5-10 years) should affect peatland resilience more than a general trajectory over 100 years. These results are exploratory in nature, but suggest that more field data is necessary to improve prediction models.
