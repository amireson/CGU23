Mean annual air temperatures are increasing rapidly in Northwestern Canada, which is among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. Consequently, permafrost thaw is proceeding at a rate not found in the historical record, with rates especially high in the peatland-dominated southern margin of discontinuous permafrost. In this region, forested peat plateaus are underlain by ice-saturated permafrost, while wetlands such as collapse-scar bogs and channel fens are permafrost free. As this permafrost thaws, the peat plateau ground surfaces subside. This process has transformed forest to wetland over much of this region. This landcover change has driven hydrological changes, including rising mean annual basin discharge. Such increases are far in excess of what can be accounted for by changes in precipitation and were shown to be driven by the expansion of runoff contributing areas, as permafrost “barriers” are removed with thaw. To better understand how permafrost thaw impacts flow and storage processes of peat plateau-wetland complexes, a detailed water balance was undertaken for a collapse-scar bog and surrounding drainage area. During the growing season (April-August) of 2022, measurements of overland and subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, precipitation and storage change were collected. A water balance was computed from hydrometric and isotopic measurements and compared to water balances completed in growing seasons of 2014, 2015 and 2016. Preliminary results indicate increased wetland growth and drainage contributing areas. Further results from the water balance will be discussed. This research furthers understanding how hydraulic flow and storage within wetlands will change with continued permafrost loss.
