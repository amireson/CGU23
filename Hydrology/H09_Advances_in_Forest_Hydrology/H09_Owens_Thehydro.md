In 2003, a major wildfire burnt a large portion of Fishtrap Creek watershed (158 km2), which drains into the North Thompson River near Kamloops, BC. A Water Survey of Canada gauging station at the outlet of Fishtrap Creek provided stream flow prior to the fire. Monitoring of stream flow and suspended sediment flux in Fishtrap Creek and the adjacent, unburnt Jamieson Creek over the period 2004 to 2020 has provided an opportunity to assess the hydrological and geomorphological responses of Fishtrap Creek to the McLure wildfire. While there were some changes in stream flow and suspended sediment flux due to the wildfire, the initial response was fairly muted. Indeed, the average specific sediment yields for both watersheds (2004-2010) were essentially the same at about 3 t/km2/year. The main changes were shifts in the timing of stream flow and sediment fluxes (i.e., earlier freshet), and changes in the sources of fine sediment delivered to the channel. In recent years, stream flows and suspended sediment fluxes have been noticeable greater than the immediate post-fire period, associated with high precipitation and flooding events. Furthermore, recent stream flow and suspended sediment fluxes in the unburnt Jamieson Creek watershed were much greater than the watershed burnt in 2003. The research demonstrates the complex responses of forested watersheds to wildfire and extreme climate events.
