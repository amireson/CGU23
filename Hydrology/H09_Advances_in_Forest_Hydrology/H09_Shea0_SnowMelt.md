Alpine krummholz stands provide critical habitat for a wide range of alpine mammals, act as incubators for a seedling establishment in harsh environments, and serve as snow fences in windblown alpine regions. In this study, we examine the role of alpine krummholz stands in ground temperature regulation and snow melt dynamics using paired observations of near-surface temperatures within and adjacent to nine alpine krummholz stands and above Conrad Glacier in the Purcell Mountains of British Columbia. The sites were instrumented in the summer of 2021 with Hobo temperature sensors, and stand characteristics (species, height, and area) were obtained in 2022 when the sensors were retrieved. The paired temperature observations highlight the role of krummholz stands in minimizing ground temperature extremes during snow-free periods, but no significant temperature differences were observed between in-stand and nearby ground surfaces during winter. In areas with deeper snowpacks, the timing of snow disappearance within krummholz stands was 2-3 weeks earlier. We suggest that this is due to increased absorption of shortwave radiation and enhanced longwave radiation emission from tree branches and trunks, and reductions in longwave radiation losses under the krummholz canopy.
