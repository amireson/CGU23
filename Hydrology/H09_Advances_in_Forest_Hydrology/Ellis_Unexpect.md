As drought and prolonged water stress become more prevalent in arid regions, preserving water resources has become the focal point of many conversations. Forest regeneration after deforestation can lead to over-populated juvenile stands with high water demands and low water use efficiency. Forest thinning improves tree health and water use while decreasing stand demands in arid and semi-arid regions. However, little is known about the impacts of over-population on seasonal variation in depth to water uptake nor the magnitude of the effect of growing season drought conditions on water availability. Existing reports are highly variable by climatic region, species, and thinning intensity. In this study, stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) in water collected from soil and branches of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) under different degrees of thinning over the growing season and analyzed using the MixSIAR model to calculate the relative contributions of various water sources in the Okanagan Valley in the interior of British Columbia. We found that lodgepole pine trees shift their depth to water uptake depending on water availability under drought conditions and rely on older precipitation events that percolate through the soil profile when shallow soil water becomes less accessible. Our results support other findings by indicating that lodgepole pines are drought-tolerant and have dimorphic root systems. Still, interestingly, forest thinning did not cause a significant change in depth to water uptake.
