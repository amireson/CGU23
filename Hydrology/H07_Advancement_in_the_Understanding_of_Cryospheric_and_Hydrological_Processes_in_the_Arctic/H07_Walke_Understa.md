Ice wedge polygons are permafrost features that form from winter thermal contraction, but the rapidly warming Arctic climate threatens them. The warming ground temperatures, increasing active layer thaw, and changing snow patterns are expected to change surface hydrology and freshwater lakes, including the potential for catastrophic thermokarst lake drainage. To better understand these interactions, high-resolution hydrological models must be applied, but field data at resolutions comparable to these models is required. In the summer of 2022, we instrumented an ice-wedge polygon field with boreholes and use a combination of field sampling and drones to monitor changes to the surface and subsurface hydrological and thermal regimes. Here we present an analysis of the permafrost conditions along several transects with a focus on polygon centre, rim, and trough regions. We provide a synthesis of the monitoring work to date and an introductory analysis of the interactions between snow, topography, and thermal regimes. This data will serve as an invaluable tool for ongoing hydrological modelling work of permafrost conditions in the western Canadian Arctic.
