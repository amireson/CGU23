Amidst the changing climate, lake ice has experienced thinner and shorter durations. Since lake ice in the temperate region has a different composition than arctic lake ice, due to the wetter and warmer climate, midwinter thaws, and frequent slushing events, examining how heat flows through the ice will aid in understanding how lake ice regimes are changing in these regions. This research spans 2017-2022 and investigates the heat flux through ice using ice thickness decay and growth. The study centres on two lakes in Central Ontario that represent typical lakes across the region. Snow and ice measurements were collected weekly through the ice season (snow depth, density, temperature, grain type, albedo, ice thickness, type), while ice decay and growth were determined using a Shallow Water Ice Profiler (SWIP). Local meteorological conditions were monitored on shore. White ice thickness has ranged from 5 cm in 2018 to 46 cm in 2019. Black ice reached a maximum thickness of 40 cm in 2018 and had a thin measurement of 1 cm in the start of 2017. There was a total of 18 weeks throughout the years where black ice decay was recorded; however, there was white ice decay in 15 weeks. Furthermore, the range of snow depth recorded was a high of 40 cm (mid-season, 2022) and a low of 0 cm (end-of-season, throughout several years). This research will aid the understanding of white ice and black ice growth and decay in relation to slushing events, temperature, snowpack temperatures, and precipitation.
