The summer of 2021 in Inuvik, NT had the seventh warmest summer and driest July recorded to date. Siksik Creek, a sub-catchment of Trail Valley Creek, found 50km north-east of Inuvik, was the focus of this study. To determine how this extreme summer impacted key hydrological processes and rates of thaw in this small Arctic tundra basin, field data was collected weekly from May to August along 15 transects that covered the entirety of the watershed and crossed a variety of terrain and vegetation types. The data collected included: frost table depths; water table depths; and stratigraphy and soil thicknesses across mineral earth hummocks and their inter-hummock zones. The GEOtop hydrological model was used to explore how the movement of water impacted thaw depths in these landscapes, the role hummocks play within this, and how snow and vegetation when added to the model affects the hydrology and thaw in the basin. Our analysis highlighted the importance of mosses and lichens in relation to hummocks and inter-hummocks, where different rates of thaw were noted. Compared to the weekly measurements, GEOtop was able to adequately represent these discrete rates across the basin, with separate signals apparent for each landscape type. This work exploits a unique opportunity to study the recent warming and drying phenomena of Arctic ecosystems and will help determine the impact on the thawing of Arctic permafrost if more of these events will occur in the future.
