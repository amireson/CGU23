Sub-Arctic and Arctic studies demonstrate a strong relationship between lake ice cover and both air temperature and large-scale atmospheric patterns. Research shows that ice cover duration is shortening in response to a warming climate, and this will increase the role of lakes within the regional energy balance, through climate variability. Lake ice models are important tools to study current and projected changes in ice covered lakes. The Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) is a well-tested one-dimensional thermodynamic freshwater ice model that has been used to successfully simulate high latitude lake ice. This study presents a comparison of measured and simulated net radiation during the ice-free period for a small lake in Resolute, NU. Model input consists of meteorological data from Environment and Climate Change Canada and simulations are validated with ice dates obtained from onshore cameras and meteorological data from a weather station deployed during the ice-free period. Preliminary results indicate that simulated net radiation has an index of agreement (IA) of 0.41 to 0.57; while net solar radiation has an IA of 0.80 and net longwave radiation has an IA of 0.64 to 0.81. These results show the importance of understanding how net radiation and its components are derived within CLIMo, so that we can understand their variability and contribution to a small arctic lake’s energy balance. This, in turn can be used to determine how net radiation and its components will contribute and change a small lake’s energy balance under a warming climate for the High Arctic.
