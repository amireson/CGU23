This presentation will provide an introduction to CSHShydRology, an R package intended for the use of hydrologists, particularly those who practice in Canada. CSHShydRology contains functions that focus on the use of Canadian data sets, such as streamflow data from Environment Canada. CSHShydRology also contains functions that work with Canadian hydrological models, such as Raven, CRHM, Watflood, and MESH. The package has been developed to work with other Canadian R packages such as tidyhydat and whitebox. CSHShydRology is intended to encompass many different types of hydrological analyses, the functions being grouped into themes:
 
 * Statistical hydrology (trend detection, data screening, frequency analysis, regionalization)
 
 * Basic data manipulation (input/conversion/adapter functions, missing data infilling)
 
 * Visualization (data visualization, mapping, standardized plotting functions)
 
 * Spatial hydrology (basin delineation, landscape data analysis, working with GIS)
 
 * Streamflow measurement analysis (rating curve analysis, velocity profiles, naturalization)
 
 * Network design/analysis (homogeneity assessment)
 
 * Ecohydrology (fisheries and ecological analysis)
 
 * Wrappers/unwrappers (linking other packages to CSHShydRology)
 CSHShydRology has been developed with the assistance of the Canadian Society for Hydrological Sciences (CSHS) that is an affiliated society of the Canadian Water Resources Association (CWRA). The presentation will provide an update on the status of the package and outline current activities.

Preferred format: Oral presentation
