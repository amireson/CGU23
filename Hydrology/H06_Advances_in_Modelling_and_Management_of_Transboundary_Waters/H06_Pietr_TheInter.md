The Milk River communities in Montana began implementing irrigation as early as 1891, with the St. Mary basin in Alberta following shortly thereafter. However, by 1904, Canadian irrigators had expressed serious concerns regarding the United Statesâ€™ plans to divert water from the St. Mary River basin to the Milk River for use by US irrigators. In response, the U.S. initiated negotiations with Canada in 1908, culminating in the signing of the Boundary Waters Treaty on January 11, 1909. This treaty was designed to address water-related issues along the international border between the U.S. and Canada. Over the last century, the Accredited Officers responsible for overseeing the treaty have developed "administrative procedures" that have been adjusted within the scope of the treaty's intent. These adjustments have ensured that water use is beneficial for both countries. Our study will focus on the assessment of both structural and administrative options, using historical data analysis to evaluate different options under varying climate conditions, as well as a detailed socio-economic analysis. Efforts will be made to seek contributions from a wide range of groups with interests in water resources, including Indigenous Nations, agricultural irrigators, rural and urban communities, the public, technical experts, academia, non-governmental organizations, and various governmental agencies at the local, state, provincial, and federal levels in Canada, the United States, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana. This presentation provides an overview of the historical context leading to the current directive, and describes the study plan, engagement strategy, and expected outcomes of the directive and study.
