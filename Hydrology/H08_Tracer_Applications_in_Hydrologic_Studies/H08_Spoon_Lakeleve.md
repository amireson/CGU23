This study investigated the relationship between lake level and groundwater upwelling in the shoreline of Kootenay Lake, which hosts shore-spawning kokanee salmon that are important to the food and cultural needs of local indigenous peoples. To mitigate dewatering impacts of lake drawdown on kokanee eggs and juveniles during the October to April period, the Friends of Kootenay Lake Stewardship Society installed spawning gravels at McDonaldâ€™s Landing Regional Park to encourage spawning at greater water depths. Similar to other kokanee shore-spawning locations in Kootenay Lake, the study site is situated on an alluvial fan where groundwater upwelling in shoreline sediment is thought to help maintain favourable conditions for kokanee redds. 
 Water temperature, stable isotopes and radon were used as natural tracers to assess changes in groundwater flow during the study period. Water-levels and water temperatures were measured continuously in the lake and lakebed. Water samples were collected from surface and groundwater sources, including precipitation. The stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of lakebed porewater and water from a shoreline well were distinct from Kootenay Lake water and formed a mixing line with Duhamel aquifer groundwater. As lake levels dropped, radon concentration in lakebed porewater increased by ~30% and the temperature-modeled groundwater flow rate exhibited a six- to seven-fold increase. The study is ongoing and in year two will employ seepage meters to further quantify changes in shoreline groundwater upwelling in response to lowering of lake level in preparation for freshet.
