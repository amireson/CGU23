In remote mountain catchments, spatial resolution is rarely captured despite large subsurface, landcover, and topographical heterogeneity. Additionally, the drivers of the hydrologic connection between subcatchments (spatial hydrologic connectivity) are rarely assessed but are crucial to understand how headwater processes integrate and scale downstream. We conducted six spatially distributed sampling campaigns across 32 sites for all seasons within the 169 kmÂ² Wolf Creek Research Basin (WCRB) in Yukon Territory, Canada. We answer two questions: What is the role of seasonality and flow state on (1) spatial hydrologic connectivity; and (2) the stability of spatial patterns in chemistry across space and time in WCRB? We sampled sites for stable water isotopes, major ions, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and used a Bayesian Mixing Model (MixSIAR) to quantify stability of spatial hydrologic connectivity of headwaters changes across seasons. Additionally, we determined mean subcatchment leverage (to infer net removal or production of a solute), and spatial persistence (temporal persistence of spatial patterns) for all sites. Despite high temporal variability in discharge often present in mountainous regions, the mixing analysis suggests the subcatchments within the WCRB display a stable and consistent proportional discharge throughout the year. Leverage results indicate net DOC production during spring, due to high hydrologic connectivity with the organic soil layer and greater organic matter availability in lowland areas. Spatial patterns in chemistry were highly stable across all surveys. Our findings suggest catchment characteristics play a more significant role than seasonality in shaping both spatial hydrologic connectivity and hydro-chemical patterns in WCRB.
